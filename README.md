# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
An all encompassing Rubik's Cube Solver hoisted by JavaScript

Requirements as defined on May 5, 2021 are as follows:
- Portion of software that solves a rubik’s cube
- Follow the CFOP
    - Cross
    - F2L
    - OLL
    - PLL
- Input their own cube
- Graphical portion to the cube
- Extendable
  - Provide a cookie cutter set of algorithms
  - User can enter their own
    - Save them off somehow
- This has to be done in the browser
  - JavaScript, HTML
  - There is no back-end
- Manage State
  - Upload a state instance
  - Download a state instance
- Give hints to the user
  - Upon request
    - Click a button, hover a tooltip, etc.
- Ability to store off decisions that were made during the solution process
  - I picked moves X, Y, and Z for the Cross
  - I picked algorithm 32 for OLL
  - I picked algorithm 7 for PLL
- Dispense statistics at the end of a solve
  - At any point in time, keep track of the number of moves
  - A list of all the moves that were made
- Given a timeline of the moves that were made
  - Backtrack to any prior state of the cube
    - Know the starting state
    - Know all the moves required to get there
    - Don’t have to “remember”
      - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] starting cube looked like a giraffe, I could just start with a giraffe and do move 1, 2, 3, 4 to get up to where I was at move 5
- Nice to develop “optimal” solution
  - Minimize cube turns (regrip)
  - Minimize number of moves
    - F2L setup that leads to OLL 32 and PLL 7 (9 moves + 1 regrip + 8 moves)
    - F2L setup that leads to OLL 17 and PLL 19 (10 move + 6 moves)
  - “Weight” regrips vs moves
  - Custom enter the weight of a regrip (don’t care, never regrip, sometimes, etc.)
- Benchmark this
    - Run tests to see how good the solver is at large number of random solutions
- Solver should still be usable without graphics portion
  - Load a config file with a collection of algorithms
  - Run solves in a command prompt window
- Would be nice to adapt this to mobile users
